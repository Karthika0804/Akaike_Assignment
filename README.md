# Akaike_Assignment (NLP)
Objective
The goal of this internship assignment is to test your proficiency in natural language
processing. You will be tasked with developing a solution that can automatically generate
objective questions with multiple correct answers based on a given chapter from a subject.
The generated questions should test the reader's understanding of the chapter and have
more than one possible correct answer to increase the complexity and challenge of the
questions.The generated questions should not only test the reader's comprehension of the
chapter but also encourage them to think beyond the surface level and explore different
perspectives and possibilities. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to develop a robust
and accurate solution that can aid educators in creating engaging and challenging
assessments for their students.
