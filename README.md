# Akaike_Assignment (NLP)
Objective
The goal of this internship assignment is to test your proficiency in natural language
processing. You will be tasked with developing a solution that can automatically generate
objective questions with multiple correct answers based on a given chapter from a subject.
The generated questions should test the reader's understanding of the chapter and have
more than one possible correct answer to increase the complexity and challenge of the
questions.The generated questions should not only test the reader's comprehension of the
chapter but also encourage them to think beyond the surface level and explore different
perspectives and possibilities. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to develop a robust
and accurate solution that can aid educators in creating engaging and challenging
assessments for their students.

Data
Please download the assignment folder from here. The folder contains PDF files that are
chapters from a CBSE text book.
Assumptions
You can assume the following in the image:
● Paragraphs passed will only have one topic in it.

# Akaike Assignment(Computer Vision)

Objective
The objective of this assignment is to develop a solution using image processing techniques
to partially de-annotate an image, given an original image and a fully annotated image. The
solution should be able to de-annotate the image partially without re-annotating the original
image. The assignment will also provide a set of sample images containing original, fully
annotated, and partially annotated images for testing and evaluation purposes.The solution
should be able to identify and remove specific annotations from the fully annotated image
while preserving the underlying information of the original image. The partially de-annotated
image should not contain any unwanted annotations or distortions that may affect its
interpretation. Additionally, the solution should be able to generalize to different types of
images and annotations, and should be efficient and scalable for processing large datasets.
** Annotation of original images partially will not be considered as a solution.
You’re not allowed to use any Object Detection model on the images
Data
Please download the assignment folder from here. The dataset folder contains two Sample
Image folders that holds the below images
● original_image : Original Base Image without annotation
● fully_annotated : Fully annotated Image
● partially_annotated : Partially annotated Image
The rest of the folders are for test and will hold the below images in it
● original_image : Original Base Image without annotation
● fully_annotated : Fully annotated Image
** You are required to add the partially annotated image in the individual image paths. Your
submitted folder should consist of
● original_image : Original Base Image without annotation
● fully_annotated : Fully annotated Image
● partially_annotated : Partially annotated Resultant Image
Assumptions
You can assume the following in the image:
● There will be only two annotations per image
● There will be one dog and a cat in the image
● The annotation of the cat should be retained in the partially annotated image
